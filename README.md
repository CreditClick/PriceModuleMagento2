# CreditClick Price Module (Magento 2)

As a web shop owner you are very familiar with the orienting customer who ultimately does not
buy the product. A common reason is that at that moment the customer does not have the money
available or simply does not want to pay the amount in one go. This is a missed opportunity for
both the consumer and the webshop.

Experience shows that only 5% of consumers return to your website to buy the product after
leaving your page. In other words; 95% of potential buyers are not seen back. With offering
instalment based payments or a continuous credit portfolio, you have reduced a significant reason
for consumers not coming back.

The Price Module that CreditClick offers, works conversion-enhancing, because it is already on the
product page. Pay at once or pay X per month. This option is also displayed in the checkout
environment. The 'From Costs' are automatically calculated automatically so that a price is always
displayed that fits the consumer's spending limit.

Please note that the CreditClick Price Module is only displayed on the product page when the
product offered costs at least € 250 and up to € 1,000.
