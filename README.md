# CreditClick Price Module (Magento 2)

As a web shop owner you are very familiar with the orienting customer who ultimately does not
buy the product. A common reason is that at that moment the customer does not have the money
available or simply does not want to pay the amount in one go. This is a missed opportunity for
both the consumer and the webshop.

Experience shows that only 5% of consumers return to your website to buy the product after
leaving your page. In other words; 95% of potential buyers are not seen back. With offering
instalment based payments or a continuous credit portfolio, you have reduced a significant reason
for consumers not coming back.

The CreditClick Price Module enhances conversion by highlighting the estimated cost per month already on the product page 
and in the shopping cart ("Pay at once or pay X per month"). 
The estimated cost per month is calculated automatically and is explained to the consumer in compliance with the local credit regulation.

Please note that the CreditClick Price Module is only displayed on the product page when the
product offered amount is within the limits of the country.

|  | Minimum amount | Maximum amount |
| --- |---| --- |
| The Netherlands | € 250,- | € 1000,- |
| Germany  | € 150,- | € 5000,- |
